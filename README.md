# Single source shortest path, non-negative weights (från homework 12)
src: `Dijkstra.hs`

Doing Dijkstra in a functional language was a challenge. Eventually I got it to
work! Wow! But the second test case on Kattis fails with "Time Limit Exceeded",
likely due to not using a priority queue, which Haskell doesn't seem to have in
its standard library. But should work functionality wise!
